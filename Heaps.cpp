 * QUESTIONS:
 * What type of tree is required to implement a heap?
 *    Why does it matter? (For what operations to function
 *    do we need that type of tree)
 * 
 * How are BSTs and Heaps similar? How are they different?
 * 
 * What is the height of a Heap with N nodes in it?
 * 
 * Describe the process of inserting a new value into a max-heap
 * 
 * What is the runtime complexity of insert()? Why?
 *    
 *    BONUS: Can you think of a case when insert() might be
 *           especially slow? Think Dynamic Arrays... 
 * 
 * Describe the process of removing the top value from a max-heap
 * 
 * What is the runtime complexity of remove()? Why?
 * 
 * Describe the process of building a max-heap from an array of
 *    unordered values
 * 
 * What is the runtime complexity of heapify()? Why?
